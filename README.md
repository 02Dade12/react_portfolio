# My React Portfolio

Hello, 

My name is Enrique Collazo and thank you for coming to my page! This portfolio page was created to house all my personal designs and thoughts in one place. I’m a multifaceted person with over 10+ years of Customer Service & Administraive Expereince. My main interest are business, technology, and fitness. I am a self-starter, excel in organizational structure, analytics, understand agile project management, and have a knack for problem solving. 

I enjoy time with my family and working on my business; I’m married and a father of 2. When I’m not working or with the family, I spend my time on the mat practicing Jiu-Jitsu or playing Xbox. 

Please feel free to take a look around and reach out to me for any inquiries.

Thanks & Enjoy!
